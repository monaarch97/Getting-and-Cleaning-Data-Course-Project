The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

This repository contains the following files:
README.md provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
tidy_data.txt, which contains the data set.
CodeBook.md, describes the contents of the data set (data, variables and transformations used to generate the data).
run_analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the data set.
